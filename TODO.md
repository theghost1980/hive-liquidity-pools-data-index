## Critical //TODO

1. Change actual location of DB to ../[root]/BD-Central. This way the DB will be read/write from the same folder in the parents folder.
2. Change BD folder name to [BD-hlpindex]. This way in the future we may use same nomenclature [BD]-[project=initials].
3. Change the way the function updateServerData() works so you can:
   - run it locally when needed or maybe add a special endpoint that uses hive keychain even locally to solve a challenge, sign it and execute the local Data backup.
4. Update from production site: (sytes or test).
5. Now you will be able to fix the calculation route.
6. add 2 more sources for HBD and HIVE prices(coinmarkeetcap, etc).
7. Find a way to get the quote & base percetanges used in tribaldex, ask chat how we handle this?
8. Plug & Pray :D
